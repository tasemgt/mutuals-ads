Steps to set up mutuals prototype üõ†Ô∏è
========

About Project
================
This project is a Django/React based recommendation system that connects users with relevant events based on their interests and group affiliations. Users are assigned to groups and subgroups using a clustering algorithm informed by shared interests, age, budget, and location. Each group has a name that reflects user interests, which are parsed and used to match users with upcoming events. Events are stored in a structured database and can be filtered dynamically to return personalized suggestions, ensuring users see only the most relevant and engaging opportunities.


Initial Setup
================
 - Clone the project repo and navigate to the directory
 - Open in vscode for better coding management & experience
     
     ```
     git clone git remote add origin https://github.com/tasemgt/mutuals-ads.git
     
     ```

BackEnd Setup
================

Prequisites:
- Python/Pip

1. **Prepare Code & Environment**
   - Navigate into mutuals code directory `cd mutuals-ads`
   - Create a python virtual env (To keep packages clean and organised in an environment) `python -m venv venv` and `source venv/bin/activate`  (On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`)
   - Run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies
   - Navigate into mutuals backend `cd mutuals_backend`
   - Run the commands to setup db sqlite and migrate schema definitions
     ```
        python manage.py makemigrations
        python manage.py migrate
     
     ```
   - Start the python backend server `python manage.py runserver`
   - Open the url `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/` on your browser and ensure you can see the following:
     ```
      HTTP 200 OK
      Allow: OPTIONS, GET
      Content-Type: application/json
      Vary: Accept
      
      {
          "Success": "Setup was successful"
      }
     
     ```
2. **Seed the Database with clustered users from file `clustered_mutuals.csv`**
   - Open a new terminal in the same `mutuals_backend` directory and ensure you're in your virtual environment by running `source venv/bin/activate` to activate it then run the command `python seed_data.py --interests` to seed the database with interests, `python seed_data.py --events --file='./data/mock_events.csv'` to seed the database with events and `python seed_data.py --groups --file='./data/groups.json'` (`groups.json` should contain groups from initial clustering) and then finally the users `python seed_data.py --users` to add the 1500 users from our csv file. You can verify this by opening the `db.sqlite3` file on DB Browser, and check `mutuals_app_user` and so on...
   - You can also verify by visiting `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/users` on the browser and seeing all users and their interests. As we can see, groups and subgroups are null at this point.



FrontEnd Setup
================

Prequisites:
- Nodejs v18 or v20 (Install for your OS via `https://nodejs.org/en/download`)
- Test your installation by running `node -v` and see the version number

1. **Installation and setup**
   - Open a new terminal and navigate into the folder mutuals frontend `cd mutuals_frontend`
   - Run the command `npm install` to install all front end dependencies
   - Run the command `npm run dev` to start up the react platform and access on the browser via `http://localhost:3000`. Make sure no other application is using port 3000.
   - You should see the Mutuals home screen as shown in the image below.

2. **Testing out the platform**
   - You can check for a users `user_id` in the database or the python-django api at `` and copy a user id.
   - Click the 'Enter Dashboard' button Paste or type such id into the 'Enter your User ID' field and proceed.
   - This will navigate you to the dashboard of that user showing his interests, group, subgroup, and fellow mutuals if any.

   - To create a new user, go to 'Getting started' and fill in the fields, then hit Register. This should create a new user and our ML model then assigns this user a group and then a subgroup using age and budget that would be displayed on their dashboard.
   - You can confirm new users created from your db.
